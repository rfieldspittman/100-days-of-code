# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Hello, welcome to my 100 Days of Code log.  My goals are to practice what I've learned in various courses I've taken.  I want to finish/refactor projects that I have already started.  I would like also to complete a few portfolio-worthy projects.  As I am a relative beginner, I will be doing some of my practicing on freecodecamp.org.  I believe I have already finished HTML and CSS there and would like to finish the rest of the path.  I want to put my skills into action and gain the confidence that comes with experience.  

1/5/20 - Goals added:  
1.  After I finish the "Responsive Web Design Certification" in freecodecamp, I would like to start "Front End Libraries Certification."  
2.  Work on very small projects such as animating part of a web page, creating a form, etc.  

2/1/20 - Goals added:
I want to take part of this time to explore Python.

2/12/20 - I decided it would benefit me to learn Bootstrap.  I think it will make creating navbars much easier.  I might also decide that I need to know Sass, as a lot of the Bootstrap documentation mentions it.  


### Day 1: January 1, 2020 

**Today's Progress** 
Forked "100 days" repo.  Worked on "Applied visual design" section of freecodecamp.org.  Did 10 lessons covering animations.

### Day 19: January 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress** 
Did 25% of the basic JavaScript section in fcc.  I do plan to finish the projects in the first track later, but just didn't have the energy to star the next one today.

I learned that the % is the remainder operator in JavaScript, not the modulus.

Working on landing page project.  Working in VS code, will copy over to copepen later so I can share.  So far I have a working navbar :) that doesn't use JavaScript.  It uses a "checkbox trick" to hide the hamburger bar on desktop.

### Day 28: January 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress** 
Still working on freecodecamp JavaScript lessons.
**Thoughts** 
There are a couple of lessons that felt a little advanced.  So, I have been spinning my wheels the last few days.  There was a lesson on JSON, and now one about recursion.  I really think I need to look into these further on another website.  I feel I need to understand them better before moving on.  Also, once I reach a certain point I am going to switch over entirely and learn some Python.  I have been thinking for a while that I would like to know how to do some small useful things in Python.  I don't know where it will lead, but I think I need a change of pace for a little while.

**Thoughts** 
For Bootstrap I am coding along with a lesson in Treehouse.  For Python, I am following along in a YouTube video series called "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart.  I am also (in my down time when I am working, usually) trying to watch all the videos for Harvard's CS50 (2019) course.

### Day 44: February 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress** 
Working on the full version of the tech conference page (Treehouse - Bootstrap).
**Thoughts** 
While learning Bootstrap, it seems to me that so far we haven't written any CSS.  So I guess Bootstrap is just a library of someone else's set CSS styles that you can cheat off of. :)
