# 100 Days Of Code - Log #2 (reboot)

I started the 100DaysOfCode challenge at the beginning of 2020, and I made it more than halfway through.  Then I got sick, and shortly afterwards, the coronavirus crisis began and things got hectic.  It has been a struggle to find time for coding while also trying to "home school" the kids.  In any case, I am going to attempt a reboot of this challenge, as I am finally getting accustomed to this "new normal".
  
Disclaimer: Although I appreciate the rules set out for the challenge, I probably will not follow them to the letter.  I plan on doing some of my learning on Treehouse. Most of their lessons involve hands-on coding, but not all. I probably will not post on Twitter every day.  I will try and post completed projects or interesting articles, etc. that I find along the way. I will try to not miss too many days, but at the same time I don't think I want to start over from the beginning again.  So it will be what it will be, and I will do my best.

New (updated) goals for this challenge reboot:
  
1. Complete the Responsive Web Design Certification in freecodecamp.org. The only thing I have left is to make a portfolio site, and I would like to attach my finished projects to it.
  
2. Complete Skillcrush web development course.  I got 90% done with this course, but I decided I wasn't really interested in learning Ruby.  However, I just want to be able to check this off as something I completed.
  
3. Continue learning Python and make a couple of projects.
  
4. Refresh JavaScript skills and add more advanced skills like React.  
  
  
  
*Original (New Year's) goals for this challenge:*

*Hello, welcome to my 100 Days of Code log.  My goals are to practice what I've learned in various courses I've taken.  I want to finish/refactor projects that I have already started.  I would like also to complete a few portfolio-worthy projects.  As I am a relative beginner, I will be doing some of my practicing on freecodecamp.org.  I believe I have already finished HTML and CSS there and would like to finish the rest of the path.  I want to put my skills into action and gain the confidence that comes with experience.*  

*1/5/20 - Goals added:*  
*1.  After I finish the "Responsive Web Design Certification" in freecodecamp, I would like to start "Front End Libraries Certification."*  
*2.  Work on very small projects such as animating part of a web page, creating a form, etc.*  

*2/1/20 - Goals added:*
*I want to take part of this time to explore Python.*

*2/12/20 - I decided it would benefit me to learn Bootstrap.  I think it will make creating navbars much easier.  I might also decide that I need to know Sass, as a lot of the Bootstrap documentation mentions it.  --Note: I did complete a Bootstrap course in Treehouse.*


### Day 1: April 9, 2020 

**Today's Progress** 
Working on JavaScript in Treehouse. 

**Thoughts** 
This is mostly review, so I am trying to cover the material quickly. However, I really like the way Treehouse teaches, and I think I will soon get to a place where I will be able to fill in some of the gaps I have. I have gone through several courses which taught JavaScrip in general, but they didn't seem to tell you how all that information applies spcifically to building web pages. It's like it was up to you to connect the dots, but I never got that comfortable with it. These Treehouse lessons will be my fallback, until I get motivated to work on projects again. Probably next week I'd like to start on the portfolio project in freecodecamp, but right now I am just happy to be learning again.
