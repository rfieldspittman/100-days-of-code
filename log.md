# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Hello, welcome to my 100 Days of Code log.  My goals are to practice what I've learned in various courses I've taken.  I want to finish/refactor projects that I have already started.  I would like also to complete a few portfolio-worthy projects.  As I am a relative beginner, I will be doing some of my practicing on freecodecamp.org.  I believe I have already finished HTML and CSS there and would like to finish the rest of the path.  I want to put my skills into action and gain the confidence that comes with experience.  

1/5/20 - Goals added:  
1.  After I finish the "Responsive Web Design Certification" in freecodecamp, I would like to start "Front End Libraries Certification."  
2.  Work on very small projects such as animating part of a web page, creating a form, etc.


### Day 1: January 1, 2020 

**Today's Progress** 
Forked "100 days" repo.  Worked on "Applied visual design" section of freecodecamp.org.  Did 10 lessons covering animations.  

**Thoughts** 
Terms learned:  transform (scale, skewX, skewY), box-shadow, border-radius, ::before and ::after pseudoelements, @keyframes, animation-name, animation-duration, animation-fill-mode: forward.
