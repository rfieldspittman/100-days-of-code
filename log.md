# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Hello, welcome to my 100 Days of Code log.  My goals are to practice what I've learned in various courses I've taken.  I want to finish/refactor projects that I have already started.  I would like also to complete a few portfolio-worthy projects.  As I am a relative beginner, I will be doing some of my practicing on freecodecamp.org.  I believe I have already finished HTML and CSS there and would like to finish the rest of the path.  I want to put my skills into action and gain the confidence that comes with experience.
